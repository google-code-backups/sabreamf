#summary How to integrate/communicate with drupal

= Distinction (case sensitive terms) =

SabreAMF - is the php5 amf framework, but sabreamf - is the drupal module

= What is it? =

Drupal [http://www.drupal.org] is a well known opensource CMS(content management system). This module allows a way to communication between drupal and flash/flex clients through amf protocol.

= How sabreamf drupal module does all this =

sabreamf module was greatly inspired by an existing drupal (AMFPHP at [http://drupal.org/project/amfphp]) module that offered the same kind of functionality but that was ignored for a long period of time, but now it seems life is once again breath upon it(thank you Scott).

sabreamf module needs Drupal Services [http://drupal.org/project/Services] module to be installed and enabled.

= How to check if the gateway is working =

If you installed drupal 6 on your localhost (wamp, lampp server), then you can login as administrator user and point your browser to gateway [http://localhost/drupal/services/sabreamf] url.
If all goes well, you will see a black screen with a nice SabreAMF+Drupal logo in the middle(another ideea inspired by RubyAMF's [http://code.google.com/p/rubyamf] screen non amf clients attempting connection)

It is recommended that you read all the txt files comming with this module, as you would find useful information
